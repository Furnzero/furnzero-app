Whether you’re moving, renovating, or upgrading your space, one challenge always finds its way to the surface: what do you do with the big stuff? Mattresses, sofas, wardrobes — the pieces that are too heavy to carry, too large to ignore, and too bulky for a standard bin. 
In the Netherlands, there are several ways to dispose of mattresses and furniture, but the right option often depends on how quickly you need it gone, what condition it’s in, your municipality, access to transport, and whether you’re an individual or an organization. It also depends on whether you're aiming for the most convenient route, or one that supports circular recovery and reuse. While options vary by location, here are the five most common ways.

1. Leave it on the street on collection days (not applicable to businesses)
In many Dutch municipalities, residents can place bulky waste, such as mattresses and furniture, at specific locations for collection. Depending on your area, this might involve leaving items directly in front of your residence or at designated spots in your neighborhood.​
For instance, in Amsterdam, residents are instructed to place bulky waste on special paving stones marked 'grofvuil'. In areas without these markers, items should be left at the edge of the pavement where waste collection vehicles can easily access them. ​
The designated days may occur once a week or twice a month, depending on your city, with items placed on the street no earlier than 21:00 the night before. Collection usually takes place anytime after 07:00 the following morning.
While this option seems convenient, it comes with a trade-off because if exposed to rain or dirt, mattresses and furniture can no longer be recycled and are usually incinerated, even if they were originally eligible for material recovery. 
You can find your local bulky waste policy and schedule an appointment at Afval.nl by entering your postcode.
To avoid fines, ensure you are placing your furniture or mattress in the correct location at the appropriate time.

For businesses such as hotels, housing providers, and care facilities often face a more complex process. They are typically responsible for arranging the disposal of bulky items themselves, which involves coordinating pickups through municipal services or private waste contractors. This process also includes ensuring compliance with local regulations.

2. Schedule a municipal bulky waste pickup (Grofvuil)
Most cities also allow residents to request doorstep collection of furniture and mattresses. This requires an appointment which can take several days to schedule so planning ahead is essential.
Pickups can be scheduled online or by phone, depending on the region.
In some cities, like The Hague or Rotterdam, pickups are free of charge; in others, a fee may apply.

Important: While convenient, items collected this way are often mixed with other bulky waste, and if mattresses are wet or dirty, they typically can’t be recycled.

3. Bring it to a recycling point (Afvalbrengstation)
Most Dutch municipalities provide dedicated recycling points (afvalbrengstations) where residents can drop off furniture and mattress for free. These facilities are designed to separate and recover reusable materials like foam, steel, and textiles.
You are typically responsible for transporting the items yourself.
Locations may differ, some cities have multiple stations, others fewer.
Mattresses must be clean and dry to qualify for recycling. Amsterdam, for instance, outlines this option under its recyclepunt system.
This option is best for those who have access to a car, van, or trailer, and want to ensure the mattress is handled through official recycling channels.

4. Use a retailer’s take-back service
For mattresses, when buying a new one, some Dutch retailers offer a take-back service for your old one.
It’s typically one-for-one and this is either included in the delivery fee or offered as a small add-on.
Some retailers partner with recycling firms to ensure the old mattress is handled sustainably. This is most common with popular chains and bed stores like Beter Bed, IKEA, or Auping frequently offer this service.
For bulkier pieces like sofas, closets, take-back is less common unless you're hiring delivery and removal together — often via a third-party partner, not the retailer itself. 

5. Hire a private collection service
Private removal companies also offer mattress pickup services, especially in areas where municipal options are limited or delayed.
These services can be booked online, often with same-day or next-day availability.
They’re usually paid out-of-pocket, with costs ranging from €50-€70 per item.
Some offer recycling as part of the service; others simply transport to disposal facilities.
While convenient, it’s important to ask where the furniture or mattress ends up since recycling isn’t guaranteed unless explicitly stated.

In contrast to household waste, there is often less clarity and fewer standardised procedures for businesses, making the disposal process more fragmented and challenging. New regulations like the Extended Producer Responsibility (UPV) for mattresses, are a step toward accountability. However they still leave gaps as they don’t fully cover or enforce B2B flows and other furniture types.

That’s where we come in, not just to fill the gaps, but to help close the accountability loop.

At FurnZero, we’re asking: what if all of that could be skipped?
We're not just building a service, we're building the infrastructure that allows circularity to function where it usually breaks: at its end-of-life. Today, the weight of disposing of bulky items like mattresses and furniture rests entirely on you, often involving time-consuming coordination, high costs, and little clarity on what happens next. 
Our mission centers on businesses — hotels, housing groups, offices, organisations — that regularly deal with large volumes of furniture and mattress turnover. We’re building a system that makes furniture disposal and recovery easier, to keep materials in use for longer, and help businesses manage it in a way that’s convenient, traceable and built for circular recovery. 

If you're part of a business, hotel group, housing provider, material innovator or recovery partner navigating the challenges of furniture and mattress waste, let’s collaborate!
